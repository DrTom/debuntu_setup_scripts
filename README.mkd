Debuntu Setup Scripts
=====================

As collection of shell-functions to install and setup things in your
Debian/Ubuntu box.

Properties
----------

-   All functions are collected conveniently in one file:
    `/bin/debuntu_fun.sh`.

-   Sourcing this file will have no side effects besides defining
    functions. 

-   There is no dependency on any tool or platform to run a function. No
    ruby, python, or whatever is required.

-   Every function is "namespaced" under `debuntu_...`.

-   Every function is indempotent, i.e. calling a function once, twice,
    or more shall have the same result.

-   Applying a function can be destructive! E.g. `torquebox_install_...`
    will stop the current instance, possibly remove the installed
    version (including all deployed applications!), and reinstall
    torquebox from scratch.

Usage examples
--------------

Source the (stable) functions:

    source <(curl https://raw.github.com/DrTom/debuntu_setup_scripts/master/bin/debuntu_fun.sh)

Alternatively source from the wip (work in progress) branch: 

    source <(curl https://raw.github.com/DrTom/debuntu_setup_scripts/wip/bin/debuntu_fun.sh)

See which scripts are available:

    declare -F | grep debuntu

Have a closer look at one of them:

    declare -f debuntu_system_setup_vim

    > debuntu_system_setup_vim ()
    > {
    >     apt-get install --assume-yes vim-nox;
    >     update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/vim.nox
    > }

Invoke it:

    debuntu_system_setup_vim


You can invoke a function as some other user: 

    debuntu_invoke_as_user thomas  debuntu_ruby_rbenv_install_jruby_1.7.4

The originating user must have permissions to substitute the user identity via
`su`. The target user should have set `bash` as his default login shell. 


Extending and contributing
--------------------------

-   `bin/debuntu_fun.sh` is generated from the scripts (not functions!)
    located in `src`.

-   Invoking `build` will perform the generation. 

-   `build` requires an installed ruby interpreter but it is very simple.
    Any ruby version will do!
